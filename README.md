This repository contains my response (written in Ruby 1.9) to a one day coding challenge set in 2013 by Evgeny Shadchnev at Makers Academy in London.

To execute my code and play tic tact toe run the ruby executable 'play_tic_tac_toe.rb' is the lib directory.


The Tic Tac Toe Coding Challenge
--------------------------------

Today we're playing Tic Tac Toe. Your task is to write a class (or set of classes, as you see fit) that would pass the given test suite (for the test suite, see the separate file: given_test_suite.rb).

Feel free to modify the given test suite: add additional tests, change method signatures, etc, as long as it stays an adequate test suite for your code and covers all test cases mentioned there.

Every public method that you have must have test coverage.

Extra respect can be gained by making your TicTacToe class play at an expert level (that is: always get a draw against itself and win against a weak player).

Extra respect can also be gained by making every method as short as possible: 1-2 lines or a maximum of three if you really must.
